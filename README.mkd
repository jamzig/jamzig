# JAMZIG

JAMZIG is a Zig-based implementation of a node for the JAM (JamCore) distributed system. This project focuses on providing a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for network communication and data processing.

## What is JAM?

JAM (JamCore) is a novel blockchain protocol designed to achieve scalable, trustless computation while maintaining a high degree of coherency. It combines elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum to provide a global singleton permissionless object environment paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network.

## Why JAM?

JAM was developed to address the scalability challenges faced by existing blockchain systems while preserving the benefits of a coherent state. It aims to:

1. Increase computational throughput
2. Maintain state coherency
3. Provide a flexible and accessible platform for developers
4. Enable efficient parallel processing of tasks

## On-Chain vs. On-Core Development

JAM introduces a unique dual-execution environment:

- **On-Chain**: Similar to traditional blockchain systems, providing a coherent state and handling critical operations.
- **On-Core**: A parallelized computation environment that allows for high-throughput processing of tasks, with results later integrated into the on-chain state.

This dual approach allows JAM to achieve scalability without sacrificing the benefits of a coherent state machine.

## Key Features

- Efficient data encoding and decoding using a custom codec
- Implementation of a Merkle binary tree for data integrity verification
- A Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) for executing distributed computations
- Support for recent block management in blockchain-like structures
- Custom types and data structures optimized for performance
- Comprehensive test suite including fixtures and vector tests

The codebase is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. It leverages Zig's powerful features to ensure memory safety and high performance.
