# JAM Protocol Test Vectors and Utilities

## Overview

This repository contains a test setup with multiple submodule links to
different test vectors. As of the time of writing, we have several open Pull
Requests (PRs) for different test vectors, and using submodules was determined
to be the most appropriate way to manage this setup.

For example we have the master here which contains the safrole test vectors:

  safrole =>  https://github.com/jamzig/jamtestvectors

and we have the Codec test vectos here:

  codec => https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/12

as such we will have multiple submodules for each of them.
